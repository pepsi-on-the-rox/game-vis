## The assignment

Watch [this](https://vimeo.com/515505521/89a5046f86) video if you're unfamiliar with these next CSS properties. 
With the help of the CSS properties ```border-radius``` and ```transition```, we create a smiley that animates when hovered.
We use ```position: absolute``` alongside ```position: relative``` to be able to position elements pixel perfect. You could use ```z-index``` if you want to control which element shows 'on top' of the other.

* Create a new HTML project
* Instead of a smiley, create an abstract Marvel head in pure HTML/CSS (no SVG or images allowed).
* Don't make this your lifework, it's about practising with CSS, not about spending hours and hours creating the most lit marvel head ever :smiley: 
* A few elements with some correct colors will do.
* Optional challenge: make it animate while hovering!
* Be creative!
